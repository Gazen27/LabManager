The Database.sql and PopulationExample.sql files are just an example of Database that could work fine with the application contained in "LabManager" folder;
We know that the structure of the DB could be more complex, those examples are just useful to let the application work.

The real project about the Database part is a bit different and it's not uploaded on this GitHub repository
